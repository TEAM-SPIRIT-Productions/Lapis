Lapis is a Plug-n-Play Azure v316 Discord Bot that relies on the [Lazuli API](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/Lazuli).

Lapis is inspired by the [MapleDiscBot](https://github.com/Bratah123/MapleDiscBot) project, but aims to be leaner and more idiot-proof.  
Lapis allows access to character and inventory attributes in [AzureMSv316](https://github.com/SoulGirlJP/AzureV316)-based databases.
