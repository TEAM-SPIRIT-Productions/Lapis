Lapis is a Plug-n-Play Azure v316 Discord Bot that relies on the [Lazuli API](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/Lazuli).

Lapis is inspired by the [MaplestoryDiscBot](https://github.com/Descended/MaplestoryDiscBot) project, but aims to be leaner and more idiot-proof.  
Lazuli allows access to character and inventory attributes in [AzureMSv316](https://github.com/SoulGirlJP/AzureV316)-based databases.  

#### Current Status: Planning
